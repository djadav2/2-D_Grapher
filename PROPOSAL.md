**What my project is and does:**
I plan to create a 2-d grapher using Cinder. I decided to use Desmos as my inspiration since I utilize Desmos a lot and thought it would be interesting to try and replicate as much functionality as possible.

**Functionality that would be supported:** 
- Plot linear lines
- Check for intersections between lines
- Look for intercepts (x/y planes)
- Zoom in/out of the graph

**Timeline:**
- Week one: Work on implementing a Line class that takes in different slopes and intercepts.
- Week two: Work on intersections between lines and set up Cinder to support the graphing of the lines.
- Week three: Finish up everything and work on zooming in/out of the axes of the graph.

If I were to finish the project early, I would try and implement lines other than linear lines such as quadratic lines and exponential lines.
